# Cyberknights
This is a  2d interative informative  on cyber security game that i am working on :)
 It is inspired by the National Cyber Security Centre game  Cyber sprinters( it was created for the purpose of educating 7 - 11year olds about online security https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cybersprinters  
 The code is from an exiting gituser  UTKRIST KARKI i downloaded from hes repository.i have tried to look for the repository but i havent been able to find it. if some could help l'd appreciate it , becasuse that is the ethos of open source i'd like to fork it appropriately to my repo.
